Thinkpad-Scripts
================

Some scripts I use on my Thinkpad T430s.  Since I use the Trackpoint most often, they disable/enable the trackpad.  The other script slows down my Razer mouse whenever I have it plugged in.

Note that these were only tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, and Fedora 21.
